# Job Application List

This project is still in the works. Some of the current features and 
future features are described below under thier subheaders. There is
also a Resources section with all of the links and information that helped
me to solve problems in my rust code.

## Current Features

The program currently can create objects of the job and application structs.
The app struct has a vector list of jobs that are then added to a file as
the database to store the jobs that are being applied for.

## Future Features

The final product will be a webpage with a rust front and backend that
will allow users to create, add, and remove jobs, as well as access their
application links and apply from the webpage all in one place.
